Just the Facts highlights key information (quotes, names, numbers,
dates) in clear, bold colors, enabling both the casual news reader and
hardcore news junkie to glean the gist of a webpage at a glance.  Cut
through the cruft and get straight to the cold, hard facts.

By default, Just the Facts is activated for a selection of popular
news sites such as The New York Times, The Economist, and The
Washington Post, but this list can easily be modified via the options
screen (accessible from the Chrome extensions menu).
